HomeSlick is a website for selling and buying houses. Users can see all house listings, update house listings, delete house listings, and be routed to a contact page to
"contact the sellers" of a house of their choosing.

Possible features I'd like to add:
-Login/Logout feature
-Session for secure routing
-Contact page does not currently do anything...maybe have it send the info to the sellers user profile
